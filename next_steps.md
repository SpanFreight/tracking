# Next Steps After Database Migration

## 1. Restart Your Application
First, restart your Flask application to ensure it loads with the updated database schema.

```bash
# Restart your Flask application
python app.py
```

## 2. Update User Interface for Client Assignment
You'll need to update your container forms to include client selection:

- Add client dropdown to container creation form
- Add client field to container edit forms
- Consider adding batch assignment capabilities

## 3. Implement Client Management Features
If not already present:

- Create a client listing page
- Add client detail views
- Create forms for adding/editing clients

## 4. Add Client Filtering and Reporting
- Update container listings to filter by client
- Add client information to container detail pages
- Create reports showing container counts by client

## 5. Test Client-Container Relationships
- Verify that containers are properly associated with clients
- Ensure data integrity is maintained when clients are deleted

## 6. Data Migration
- Consider adding a batch process to assign existing containers to clients
